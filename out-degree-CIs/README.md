# Outdegree Plots and Confidence Intervals

## Explanation
Each folder pertains to a single individual and contains plots of the outdegree over time for each individual symptom. 
The confidence intervals were calculated via simulation where each coefficient was independently simulated 1000 times 
with a normal distribution around the point estimate and standard error. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentile outdegrees from
the thousand simulations were then used as the confidence interval.
